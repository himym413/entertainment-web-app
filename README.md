## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate between Home, Movies, TV Series, and Bookmarked Shows pages
- Add/Remove bookmarks from all movies and TV series
- Search for relevant shows on all pages
- **Bonus**: Build this project as a full-stack application
- **Bonus**: If you're building a full-stack app, we provide authentication screen (sign-up/login) designs if you'd like to create an auth flow

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [ReactRouter](https://reactrouter.com/) - Routing
- [TanstackQuery](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) - Asynchronous state management
- [ReactHookForm](https://www.react-hook-form.com) - Form management
- [ReactInfiniteScrollComponent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component) - Infinite Scroll
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) - Styling
- [ReactIcons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) - Icons
- [TMDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) - The Movie Database
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com) - Authentication and Database

### What I learned

I definitely learned a lot about TanStack React Query, especially when working with the useMutation hook and handling its onMutate state for optimistic updates. I'm very proud of my useBookmark custom hook, which manages bookmarking and unbookmarking shows with optimistic updates and error fallbacks for an optimal user experience.

### Continued development

I want to focus on learning TypeScript next and deepen my understanding of backend development, as it seems very interesting, by learning Node.js.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) - ChatGPT was really helpful in giving me new ideas and exploring different approaches while building my project.
- [Jonas Schmedtmann's Ultimate React Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course) - I would highly recommend this course to anyone looking to learn React. Building this project without the knowledge I gained from Jonas' course would have been almost impossible.
